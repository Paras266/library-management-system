## 📖 Overview

Welcome to the **Library Management System**! This Node.js application allows users to efficiently manage a library with core functionalities such as adding, borrowing, returning, and viewing books. Leveraging JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, this project showcases the power of Test-Driven Development (TDD).

## 🚀 Features

- **Add Books**: Seamlessly add new books to the library with details like ISBN, title, author, and publication year.
- **Borrow Books**: Check out books that are available and ensure that only those in stock can be borrowed.
- **Return Books**: Return books to the library, updating their status and availability.
- **View Available Books**: Quickly view a comprehensive list of all books currently available in the library.
- **Remove Books**: Efficiently remove books that are no longer required or available.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (Node.js)**: The foundation of the application, providing runtime and environment for the system.
- **Jest**: The chosen JavaScript testing framework to implement Test-Driven Development (TDD) and ensure code quality.
